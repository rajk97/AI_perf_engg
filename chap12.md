Dynamic Scheduling, CUDA Graphs, and Device-Initiated Kernel Orchestration:

- We'll understand dynamic, device-side, and graph-based kernel orchestration techniques that keep every SM fed across multi-GPU clusters. 
- When work is not evently distributed across thread blocks, SM's will sit idle. 
- Active cycles/Total elapsed SM cycles give an idea of underutilization

- Atomic Counters:
