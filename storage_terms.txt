| Term        | What It Is                           | Why It Matters for AI                         |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| XFS         | High-performance filesystem          | Handles large files + parallel I/O well       |
| NVMe        | Fast SSD protocol (PCIe)             | 10-100x faster than SATA SSD                  |
| noatime     | Skip access-time writes              | Eliminates write-per-read overhead            |
| Bursting    | Variable throughput (credit-based)   | Bad for sustained training (credits deplete)  |
| Provisioned | Fixed guaranteed throughput          | Predictable, no surprises                     |
| Max I/O     | High aggregate IOPS mode             | Better for parallel AI workloads              |

Mnemonics:
- "XFS for eXtra Fast Storage" - Use XFS for large AI datasets, not ext4
- "noatime = no wasted writes" - Every read doesn't need a timestamp write
- "Bursting = borrowing, Provisioned = owning" - Bursting runs out, provisioned is guaranteed
- "Max I/O for max parallelism" - Many workers reading simultaneously? Use Max I/O mode

All-in-one:
"XFS + noatime + Provisioned + Max I/O = AI storage happy path"
